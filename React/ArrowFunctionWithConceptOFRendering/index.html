                              <strong>Arrow Function:</strong>
                              <p>An arrow function expression is a complete alternative to a traditional function expression with some semantic differences and deliberate limitations in usage:
                                    <ul>
                                          <li>Arrow function doesn't have their own binding to <strong>This</strong>, <strong>Super</strong>, and <strong>arguments</strong> and also cannot be used as methods.</li>
                                          <li>Arrow functions cannot be used as <strong>Constructors</strong>, Calling with new keyword throws syntax error. They also don't have access to new.target keyword.</li>
                                          <li>Arrow function can implicity means auto return or explicity means using return.</li>
                                    </ul></p>

                        <strong>Binding:</strong>
                        <p>It means the association of an identifier with a value. In most of the cases in Arrow functions,the value of this depends on how it is called, that is runtime binding. In non-strict mode, the value of this is mostly object.</p>
                        <p><strong>Super:</strong> keyword is used to access properties of an objects or class [[prototype]] or invoke a superClass or Constructors.</p>
